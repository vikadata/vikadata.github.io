## What is a CRM?

Collecting, traversing, and storing data are some of the software functionalities related to the data collection software: CRM â€“ Customer Relationship Management.

Chatbots, on the other hand, are AI-powered tools that simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. They can be integrated into various platforms, such as websites, messaging apps, and social media platforms, to provide automated customer support, answer frequently asked questions, and assist with sales processes.

By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, chatbots can understand customer queries, provide relevant information, and even execute transactions. They offer a convenient and efficient way for businesses to handle customer inquiries, resolve issues, and engage with their audience 24/7.
