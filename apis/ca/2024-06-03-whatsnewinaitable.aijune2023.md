*Track records across timelines, customize interface forms, and more.*

Around this time in Canada, we get a lot of cloudy, overcast days. We lovingly refer to them as "June Gloom." But there's no such gloom here at AITable.ai thanks to these new product updates and educational resources.

## Do More with Interface Forms

AITable.ai Forms are the best way to turn others' input into data. With new fields and options in Interface Designer, you now have even more control over your interface form, and users have a more straightforward experience.

These new features include:

- **Conditional fields:** This shows or hides fields in an interface form based on how users have filled out previous fields.
- **Read-only fields:** Display an uneditable field on a form, which can provide additional context, like finalized dates or launches.
- **Limits on single/multi-select options:** You can decide which single or multi-select options users can pick when filling out a form.

These updates to AITable.ai's Interface Designer give you the power to create intuitive and personalized forms, making it easier than ever to collect the data you need.
