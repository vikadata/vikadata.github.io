In today's highly competitive business landscape, providing exceptional customer service is crucial for building and maintaining a loyal customer base. Research by Oracle suggests that 82% of consumers would switch a brand if unsatisfied with their customer service department. It's clear that a top-notch customer experience (CX) is a must.

One aspect of the customer experience is the conversations a brand has with its customers. Whether it's answering questions, resolving issues, or providing personalized recommendations, effective communication is key. This is where conversational AI comes into play.

Conversational AI refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, to engage in human-like conversations with customers. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, conversational AI systems can understand and respond to customer queries in real-time.

So, how can businesses boost customer engagement using conversational AI? Let's explore how AITable.ai, a leading productivity tool, enables businesses to create AI Agents and Custom ChatGPT with just one click.
