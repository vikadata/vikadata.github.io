- **Read-only fields:** Display uneditable fields on your forms to provide additional context or showcase finalized information, such as dates or launches.
- **Limits on single/multi-select options:** Control which options users can select when filling out a form, ensuring accurate and relevant data collection.

### Akkio: A ThoughtSpot Alternative That Delivers More for Less

Businesses are always on the lookout for cost-effective tools that provide them with a competitive edge. ThoughtSpot has been a popular choice, but there's a new player in town that's turning heads: AITable.ai's Akkio. 

Akkio is a powerful alternative to ThoughtSpot, offering a comprehensive suite of features that allow businesses to make data-driven decisions faster and at a lower cost. With generative business intelligence, streamlined data analysis, and industry-agnostic compatibility, Akkio is the ideal solution for businesses looking to harness the power of AI.

Both Akkio and ThoughtSpot offer intuitive data visualization and exploration tools with AI-powered analytics for improved decision-making. They also provide comprehensive integration and customization capabilities, as well as transparent pricing plans to maximize ROI without incurring large costs.

### How AI is transforming the customer experience in retail and eCommerce

Artificial intelligence has become an essential component in every modern business's operations, particularly in the retail and eCommerce sectors. AI has empowered businesses to tailor the customer experience to individual preferences, meeting the growing demand for personalized shopping experiences.

With more than a third of consumers expecting personalized shopping experiences and Gen-Z shoppers requiring an increasingly high level of personalization, AI is no longer an option but a necessity to thrive in the B2C arena.

AITable.ai's AI-powered tools enable businesses to leverage AI in transforming the customer experience. From personalized recommendations to chatbots that provide instant responses, AI allows businesses to engage customers in a more targeted and meaningful way, driving loyalty and satisfaction.
