# What's New in AITable.ai: July 2023

*Star your favorite apps on your home screen, update the status of projects with the new progress bar, and more.*

We just observed the summer solstice here in the northern hemisphere, which means we're already halfway through the year (how'd that happen so fast?!).

It just goes to show that it's easy to lose track of time—especially when you're only absentmindedly checking the date each day on a calendar. The same thing can happen when you're measuring the progress of your work, and all you're looking at is percentages and integers.

That's precisely why we're adding progress bars to AITable.ai. With these new, colorful progress bars, you'll always be able to tell exactly how close your projects are to completion.

We've also redesigned the home screen so teams can quickly find the apps they need. Read on for details, or check out What's New (in 2) if you only have a couple minutes to spare.
