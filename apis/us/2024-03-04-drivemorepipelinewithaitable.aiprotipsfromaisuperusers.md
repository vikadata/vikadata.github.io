Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline üéµ
Like a refrain in a trending song, we‚Äôve all been hearing ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù on repeat ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs in team meetings, company-wide emails, or even on LinkedIn. And that‚Äôs to no one‚Äôs surprise: A report by Ebsta and Pavilion found that pipeline generation dropped by 42% in 2022, and has yet to recover.

For this reason, today‚Äôs go-to-market (GTM) teams are having to critically examine and revise how they drive revenue to future-proof their businesses. But, with customer expectations growing, new tools flooding the market every day, and a greater emphasis on doing more with less, building a reliable digital pipeline can be challenging.

That is, unless you adopt a conversational strategy that engages site visitors in real time while also providing buyer insights to better inform your GTM strategy.

To show you how it‚Äôs done, I spoke with three of AITable.ai's top customers who have wholeheartedly adopted the conversational approach. Because, as the owner of AITable.ai on AITable.ai, I understand the need to drive more pipeline and stay ahead of the competition.
