  - Content: Notion and Evernote are just two of the several leading project management tools on the market, like monday.com to name a few!

While they have key differences that should be noted, the two tools have very similar goals.

Evernote was built as an organizational note-taking app that also keeps users’ files in one place.

In this article we’ll be looking at everything you could need to know about the two, so you can make the smartest choice about which way to go once we’re done. We’ll be checking out the main features, pricing, and other considerations for your note-taking pleasure.

Scrum is defined as a popular project management approach based on the Agile methodology. 

**In short, Scrum offers teams a new way to address complex challenges.**

Designed to be flexible, Scrum requires teams to deliver work in iterative chunks known as “sprints.” Each sprint lasts one to two weeks on average, and the Scrum team reviews the work delivered at the end of every sprint.

By the time their owners turn to FidoCure, the prospects for dogs like Adley and Lulu can be grim. 

Adley, a six-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback, went to the vet for a cough in 2020 that turned out to be a lung tumor. Lulu, a 12-year-old Akita Inu, got a thyroid cancer diagnosis in 2017, which many dogs survive. But the tumors spread to her lymph nodes two years later, leaving her family to consider treatments like chemotherapy. 

But both dogs are now beating the odds, alive and well—thanks to a genetic testing program called [FidoCure](https://www.fidocure.com/about-us?ref=blog.airtable.com), which uses Airtable to run its business.

If you’re anything like us, you depend on your boards, workflows, and notifications to keep your daily work moving forward. And we’re big believers in letting people do their work the way that works best for them, that’s why we rebuilt our desktop app *from scratch.*

**What does this mean for you?**

It means a smoother, better experience, feature updates, and new functionalities that will have your whole team rushing to the app store.

We surveyed more than 300 marketing professionals to see how their roles have changed in the last year. These are the highlights.
If you work in marketing, you’re accustomed to change. You’re familiar with the energy it takes to keep up with new tools, new challenges, new strategies—and you’re constantly weighing that investment against the time you’re spending on the actual work of marketing itself.  

The rate of change shows no signs of slowing. As businesses adjust their growth strategies in the face of [potential economic downturn](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/28/business/economy-news-inflation-stocks?ref=blog.airtable.com#recession-probability-us), marketing teams are under pressure to boost efficiency and optimize technology spend. In our recent **[survey of more than 300 marketing leaders](https://try.airtable.com/lp/report/2022-marketing-trends-report?ref=blog.airtable.com)**, we found they are struggling to keep their teams connected, inspired, and performant as the

*But what is scrum? And what are scrum roles within the realm of Agile project management?*

We’re going to look at the basics of both scrum and agile, so keep reading.

What is Scrum?
--------------

Scrum is defined as a popular project management approach based on the Agile methodology. 

**In short, Scrum offers teams a new way to address complex challenges.**

Designed to be flexible, Scrum requires teams to deliver work in iterative chunks known as “sprints.” Each sprint lasts one to two weeks on average, and the Scrum team reviews the work delivered at the end of every sprint. 

Here’s how we use Scrum at monday.com:

FidoCure streamlined processes to treat more dogs, and pulled off the largest-ever canine genomics study.
By the time their owners turn to FidoCure, the prospects for dogs like Adley and Lulu can be grim. 

Adley, a six-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback, went to the vet for a cough in 2020 that turned out to be a lung tumor. Lulu, a 12-year-old Akita Inu, got a thyroid cancer diagnosis in 2017, which many dogs survive. But the tumors spread to her lymph nodes two years later, leaving her family to consider treatments like chemotherapy. 

But both dogs are now beating the odds, alive and well—thanks to a genetic testing program called [FidoCure](https://www.fidocure.com/about-us?ref=blog.airtable.com), which uses Airtable to run its business.

It doesn’t have to be that way, though. You can write a great [business plan](https://monday.com/blog/project-management/business-plan-template/) and deliver it — almost — without breaking a sweat. The key to success is summarizing your thoughts in a concise summary.

Even if you don't want to become fully Agile-certified, you can incorporate aspects of the Agile methodology into your company's workflow.
Behind all the certifications and seminars, the idea behind Agile is relatively simple:


* Build something your customers want
* Ship it fast
* Change it based on feedback


Even if you don't want to become fully Agile certified, a [workflow](https://blog.airtable.com/what-is-a-workflow/) that incorporates aspects of the Agile methodology—a small-a “agile” workflow—is a good idea for virtually any team to adopt.

In this article we’ll be looking at everything you could need to know about the two, so you can make the smartest choice about which way to go once we’re done. We’ll be checking out the main features, pricing, and other considerations for your note-taking pleasure.
