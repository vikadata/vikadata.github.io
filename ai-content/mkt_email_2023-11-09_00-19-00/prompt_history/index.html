<li>Content: Making an IT policy template from scratch is hard work. Even if you get your in-house IT expert to write it for you, it’ll be a challenging task for them — unless they’re also a lawyer or have created similar policies in the past. Then there’s the second option — hire an outside consultant. This is a great alternative if you have money to spend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have the third option — and the best one for most businesses — and that’s using a pre-made IT policy template. In this article, we’ll tell you what IT policy templates are and why they’re used. We’ll also give you quality templates you can easily incorporate into your current IT administrative system.</p>

Low-code and no-code development platforms empower organizations to build the software they need.
The tech world has been whispering about low-code development for years, but <em>now</em>, some knowledge of low-code is considered table stakes for organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>A handful of macro trends have nudged low-code application development into the limelight, and now the movement is having a moment. </p>
<p>A low-code or no-code approach to creating apps (using visual interfaces, rather than coding languages) helps companies let more people in on the process of building software. That’s a game-changer for companies of all sizes across every industry, especially in times when companies are looking to consolidate tools. Now, it’s more important than ever for orgs to find tools <em>everyone</em> can use, rather than spend thousands on niche alternatives for specific teams.</p>

Test your inputs with the great and powerful “IF.”
IF functions (sometimes known as “IF statements”) may sound intimidating, but they're actually one of the most commonly used functions in databases and spreadsheets–and they can do a <em>lot</em> of heavy lifting for companies looking to gleam insights about their data. </li>
</ul>
<p>In a formula, they let you compare inputs and take one action if the result is true, or another action if the result is false. The idea of “if” comes up in all kinds of logical choices. For example: “If I follow the yellow brick road, I’ll get to see the Wizard of Oz.” If an input is true, you follow the yellow road and see the wizard. If the input is false and you choose not to follow the road, you don’t see the wizard at all.</p>
<p>Here’s another example that might apply to your organization: say you’re in the middle of several large marketing campaigns. You’d like to know which of them have budgets over $50,000 and which are under. Applying an IF function can give you that </p>

<p>Content: Like the phrase “buying journey” implies, sales deals are kind of like road trips, with buyers and sellers working together to reach their final destination — a closed deal. And while this is still true in the digital era, the way that buyers and sellers interact has shifted.
In the past, sellers were the ones responsible for driving deals forward. But now, as most buyers prefer remote or self-service interactions, they’re the ones in the driver’s seat. They decide what channels to use, which resources to download, and when they’re ready to jump into a conversation with a sales rep.
Our job as sellers, then, is to hold the map — to handle the navigation and make sure buyers can get to where they want to go, quickly and easily. Because the more frictionless the buying experience is, the faster you will be able to get to a closed deal.
So, how do you deliver that frictionless experience?
By leveraging conversational solutions and artificial intelligence (AI), you can offer your buyers a </p>

<p>Content: These days, it feels like artificial intelligence (AI) is all anyone can talk about. But, it’s hard not to ask: “Is AI overhyped?”
The short answer: Definitely not.
According to McKinsey, by 2030, AI is expected to create $13 trillion in value for businesses globally. And recent innovations like ChatGPT already signal the potential that AI has to boost efficiency.
But, despite all these exciting developments, AI adoption in sales is lagging. According to Salesforce, only 33% of sales organizations today say they are using some form of AI (and many others aren’t quite sure what it means to use AI in sales at all).
So, what should sales teams do to catch up and make the most of AI? To answer this, I spoke on a webinar hosted by Revenue.io, joined by their Chief Strategy &amp; Revenue Officer, Alastair Woolcock. Here’s what you need to know 👇

Like a refrain in a trending song, we’ve all been hearing “pipeline” on repeat — whether it’s in team meetings, company-wide emails, or even on LinkedIn. And that’s to no one’s surprise: A report by Ebsta and Pavilion found that pipeline generation dropped by 42% in 2022, and has yet to recover.
For this reason, today’s go-to-market (GTM) teams are having to critically examine and revise how they drive revenue to future-proof their businesses. But, with customer expectations growing, new tools flooding the market every day, and a greater emphasis on doing more with less, building a reliable digital pipeline can be challenging.
That is, unless you adopt a conversational strategy that engages site visitors in real time while also providing buyer insights to better inform your GTM strategy.

The tech world has been whispering about low-code development for years, but <em>now</em>, some knowledge of low-code is considered table stakes for organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>A handful of macro trends have nudged low-code application development into the limelight, and now the movement is having a moment. </p>
<p>A low-code or no-code approach to creating apps (using visual interfaces, rather than coding languages) helps companies let more people in on the process of building software. That’s a game-changer for companies of all sizes across every industry, especially in times when companies are looking to consolidate tools. Now, it’s more important than ever for orgs to find tools <em>everyone</em> can use, rather than spend thousands on niche alternatives for specific teams.</p>

LLMs are great for querying vast amounts of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWKnezZp9qk">unstructured data</a>, typically found in documents like PDF and plaintext files, but programmatic queries are much better suited to organized data (think things like tables and spreadsheets).</p>

Test your inputs with the great and powerful “IF.”
IF functions (sometimes known as “IF statements”) may sound intimidating, but they're actually one of the most commonly used functions in databases and spreadsheets–and they can do a *lot* of heavy lifting for companies looking to gleam insights about their data. 

  In a formula, they let you compare inputs and take one action if the result is true, or another action if the result is false. The idea of “if” comes up in all kinds of logical choices. For example: “If I follow the yellow brick road, I’ll get to see the Wizard of Oz.” If an input is true, you follow the yellow road and see the wizard. If the input is false and you choose not to follow the road, you don’t see the wizard at all.

Here’s another example that might apply to your organization: say you’re in the middle of several large marketing campaigns. You’d like to know which of them have budgets over $50,000 and which are under. Applying an IF function can give you that

In the past, sellers were the ones responsible for driving deals forward. But now, as most buyers prefer remote or self-service interactions, they’re the ones in the driver’s seat. They decide what channels to use, which resources to download, and when they’re ready to jump into a conversation with a sales rep.
Our job as sellers, then, is to hold the map — to handle the navigation and make sure buyers can get to where they want to go, quickly and easily. Because the more frictionless the buying experience is, the faster you will be able to get to a closed deal.
So, how do you deliver that frictionless experience?
By leveraging conversational solutions and artificial intelligence (AI), you can offer your buyers a

  - Description: Test your inputs with the great and powerful “IF.”
  - Content: 
Test your inputs with the great and powerful “IF.”
IF functions (sometimes known as “IF statements”) may sound intimidating, but they're actually one of the most commonly used functions in databases and spreadsheets–and they can do a *lot* of heavy lifting for companies looking to gleam insights about their data. 

  In a formula, they let you compare inputs and take one action if the result is true, or another action if the result is false. The idea of “if” comes up in all kinds of logical choices. For example: “If I follow the yellow brick road, I’ll get to see the Wizard of Oz.” If an input is true, you follow the yellow road and see the wizard. If the input is false and you choose not to follow the road, you don’t see the wizard at all.

Here’s another example that might apply to your organization: say you’re in the middle of several large marketing campaigns. You’d like to know which of them have budgets over $50,000 and which are under. Applying an IF function can give you that

In the past, sellers were the ones responsible for driving deals forward. But now, as most buyers prefer remote or self-service interactions, they’re the ones in the driver’s seat. They decide what channels to use, which resources to download, and when they’re ready to jump into a conversation with a sales rep.
Our job as sellers, then, is to hold the map — to handle the navigation and make sure buyers can get to where they want to go, quickly and easily. Because the more frictionless the buying experience is, the faster you will be able to get to a closed deal.
So, how do you deliver that frictionless experience?

According to McKinsey, by 2030, AI is expected to create $13 trillion in value for businesses globally. And recent innovations like ChatGPT already signal the potential that AI has to boost efficiency.
But, despite all these exciting developments, AI adoption in sales is lagging. According to Salesforce, only 33% of sales organizations today say they are using some form of AI (and many others aren’t quite sure what it means to use AI in sales at all).

Like a refrain in a trending song, we’ve all been hearing “pipeline” on repeat — whether it’s in team meetings, company-wide emails, or even on LinkedIn. And that’s to no one’s surprise: A report by Ebsta and Pavilion found that pipeline generation dropped by 42% in 2022, and has yet to recover.
For this reason, today’s go-to-market (GTM) teams are having to critically examine and revise how they drive revenue to future-proof their businesses. But, with customer expectations growing, new tools flooding the market every day, and a greater emphasis on doing more with less, building a reliable digital pipeline can be challenging.

Low-code and no-code development platforms empower organizations to build the software they need.
The tech world has been whispering about low-code development for years, but *now*, some knowledge of low-code is considered table stakes for organizations.

Why?

A handful of macro trends have nudged low-code application development into the limelight, and now the movement is having a moment. 

A low-code or no-code approach to creating apps (using visual interfaces, rather than coding languages) helps companies let more people in on the process of building software. That’s a game-changer for companies of all sizes across every industry, especially in times when companies are looking to consolidate tools. Now, it’s more important than ever for orgs to find tools *everyone* can use, rather than spend thousands on niche alternatives for specific teams.

When users ask questions about topics like the price of a given item, or the date of an event, it’s important that your chatbot provides accurate, reliable answers.

A low-code or no-code approach to creating apps (using visual interfaces, rather than coding languages) helps companies let more people in on the process of building software. That’s a game-changer for companies of all sizes across every industry, especially in times when companies are looking to consolidate tools. Now, it’s more important than ever for orgs to find tools *everyone* can use, rather than spend thousands on niche alternatives for specific teams.

Read on to learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of low-code and no-code development, plus some best practices for deploying

  - Content: 
Test your inputs with the great and powerful “IF.”
IF functions (sometimes known as “IF statements”) may sound intimidating, but they're actually one of the most commonly used functions in databases and spreadsheets–and they can do a *lot* of heavy lifting for companies looking to gleam insights about their data. 

  In a formula, they let you compare inputs and take one action if the result is true, or another action if the result is false. The idea of “if” comes up in all kinds of logical choices. For example: “If I follow the yellow brick road, I’ll get to see the Wizard of Oz.” If an input is true, you follow the yellow road and see the wizard. If the input is false and you choose not to follow the road, you don’t see the wizard at all.

Here’s another example that might apply to your organization: say you’re in the middle of several large marketing campaigns. You’d like to know which of them have budgets over $50,000 and which are under. Applying an IF function can give you that

In the past, sellers were the ones responsible for driving deals forward. But now, as most buyers prefer remote or self-service interactions, they’re the ones in the driver’s seat. They decide what channels to use, which resources to download, and when they’re ready to jump into a conversation with a sales rep.
Our job as sellers, then, is to hold the map — to handle the navigation and make sure buyers can get to where they want to go, quickly and easily. Because the more frictionless the buying experience is, the faster you will be able to get to a closed deal.
So, how do you deliver that frictionless experience?
By leveraging conversational solutions and artificial intelligence (AI), you can offer your buyers a

In the past, sellers were the ones responsible for driving deals forward. But now, as most buyers prefer remote or self-service interactions, they’re the ones in the driver’s seat. They decide what channels to use, which resources to download, and when they’re ready to jump into a conversation with a sales rep.
Our job as sellers, then, is to hold the map — to handle the navigation and make sure buyers can get to where they want to go, quickly and easily. Because the more frictionless the buying experience is, the faster you will be able to get to a closed deal.
So, how do you deliver that frictionless experience?
By leveraging conversational solutions and artificial intelligence (AI), you can offer your buyers a

The short answer: Definitely not.
According to McKinsey, by 2030, AI is expected to create $13 trillion in value for businesses globally. And recent innovations like ChatGPT already signal the potential that AI has to boost efficiency.
But, despite all these exciting developments, AI adoption in sales is lagging. According to Salesforce, only 33% of sales organizations today say they are using some form of AI (and many others aren’t quite sure what it means to use AI in sales at all).
So, what should sales teams do to catch up and make the most of AI? To answer this, I spoke on a webinar hosted by Revenue.io, joined by their Chief Strategy & Revenue Officer, Alastair Woolcock. Here’s what you need to know 👇

Like a refrain in a trending song, we’ve all been hearing “pipeline” on repeat — whether it’s in team meetings, company-wide emails, or even on LinkedIn. And that’s to no one’s surprise: A report by Ebsta and Pavilion found that pipeline generation dropped by 42% in 2022, and has yet to recover.
For this reason, today’s go-to-market (GTM) teams are having to critically examine and revise how they drive revenue to future-proof their businesses. But, with customer expectations growing, new tools flooding the market every day, and a greater emphasis on doing more with less, building a reliable digital pipeline can be challenging.

Low-code and no-code development platforms empower organizations to build the software they need.
The tech world has been whispering about low-code development for years, but *now*, some knowledge of low-code is considered table stakes for organizations.

Why?

A handful of macro trends have nudged low-code application development into the limelight, and now the movement is having a moment. 

A low-code or no-code approach to creating apps (using visual interfaces, rather than coding languages) helps companies let more people in on the process of building software. That’s a game-changer for companies of all sizes across every industry, especially in times when companies are looking to consolidate tools. Now, it’s more important than ever for orgs to find tools *everyone* can use, rather than spend thousands on niche alternatives for specific teams.

--------------------------------------------------

When users ask questions about topics like the price of a given item, or the date of an event, it’s important that your chatbot provides accurate, reliable answers. This is what we call structured or organized data. LLMs are great for querying vast amounts of [unstructured data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWKnezZp9qk), typically found in documents like PDF and plaintext files, but programmatic queries are much better suited to organized data (think things like tables and spreadsheets).

The best way to ensure that your bot can answer questions like these accurately is to structure your data in a [Table](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/studio/tables/). That’s because information like price is associated with a specific ite
